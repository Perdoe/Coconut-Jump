# Coconut-Jump

This program is a flappy bird remastered to a coconut jumping in between trees while being on the beach.

- The image files are what render the background along with the various coconuts that are playable characters
- All code has code representing functionality to make easy to swap colors, images, functions
- Fonts are preregistred with what I have in files, able to be swaped simply (Follow comments in code)
- Code was made with Python inside of Pycharm
